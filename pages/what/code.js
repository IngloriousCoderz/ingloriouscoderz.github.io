        <p>
          Coding is a mean through which we express ourselves. It is an
          artisanal activity that mixes creativity and logic. That&apos;s why
          every project is treated like a creature we raise and nurture until it
          is able to go on its own.

              <ExtLink to="https://www.alittleb.it/">Alittleb.it</ExtLink> is
              simply the best gamification company: they created a learning
              management system called{' '}
              <ExtLink to="https://www.alittleb.it/skillato/">Skillato</ExtLink>{' '}
              which allows anyone to learn anything, while having fun in the
              process. Only one thing was missing: a tournament-based quiz game.
              A few constraints:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>It must be blazingly fast</li>
              <li>It must have shiny animations and happy sounds</li>
              <li>It must be responsive</li>
              <li>It must be well-tested</li>
              <li>It must be highly customizable</li>
              <li>It must be completed in a dozen of days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              ...And of course we delivered. The client was amazed by the
              quality of the result, by the online documentation provided in{' '}
              <ExtLink to="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</ExtLink>, by

              needed an app for the upcoming exhibition about Leonardo Da
              Vinci&apos;s machines. As soon as we got the mockups, in just two
              days we built a <ExtLink to="https://reactjs.org/">React</ExtLink>{' '}

                PWA

              and added{' '}
              <ExtLink to="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</ExtLink> to be
              able to upload Android and iOS apps on their respective stores.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the following days we supported the client in many ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>adapting the layout and graphics to the new mockups</li>
              <li>
                adding new features on the fly such as{' '}
                <ExtLink to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">

              <li>giving technical support</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When the client had timing issues with the approval of the Android
              app on the Play Store, they still had a solid PWA to show. Despite
              the odds, the presentation on the first day of the exhibition was
              a total success.
