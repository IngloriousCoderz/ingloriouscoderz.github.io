      <h1>Why</h1>
      <p>
        It's the year <code>{'/20\\d{2}/'}</code>, the Age of Information.
        Everything is connected, everything sends and receives data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans are overwhelmed by superficial information and are losing any
        deep thought, any interest in knowledge. Ensnared by consumerism, they
        are becoming mere purchasers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Machines on the other hand are evolving rapidly, gaining a role in
        society that's more and more relevant. They are replacing us in every
        aspect of life, sometimes performing better than humans even on tasks
        that we thought required human interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one knows if machines will take us over completely, when will it
        happen, and what consequences will it have. Maybe we will witness the
        realization of a utopia in which humans will just need to enjoy life.
        But meanwhile people are losing their jobs, feeling useless, and
        possibly starving.
      </p>
      <p>One of the few markets that are still thiving is IT, </p>
      <p> But IT is all about building even better machines.</p>
