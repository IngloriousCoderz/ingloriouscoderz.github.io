      <h1>Why</h1>

      <p>
        It's the year <code>{'/20\\d{2}/'}</code>, the Age of Information.
        Everything is connected, everything sends and receives data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans are overwhelmed by superficial information and are losing any
        deep thought, any interest in knowledge. Ensnared by consumerism, they
        are becoming mere purchasers.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand machines are evolving rapidly, gaining a role in
        society that's more and more relevant. They are replacing us in every
        aspect of life, sometimes performing much better than humans even on
        tasks that we thought required human interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one knows if machines will take us over completely, when will it
        happen, and what consequences will it have. Maybe we will witness the
        realization of a utopia in which humans will have nothing to do but
        enjoy life. Meanwhile, however, people are losing their jobs and
        starting to feel useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is only one thing that we humans can still do better than
        machines: being human. We feel compassion, we care for others, we love
        what we do. In this industrial, globalized, low-cost society we still
        appreciate the value of good craftsmanship.
