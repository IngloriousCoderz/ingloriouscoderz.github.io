        <p>
          Having a year of experience in Vue.js but not React, I had the
          impression of coming out of a 3-day training in React with a level
          even higher than Vue.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very good coach, ease of expression, understanding, and explanation.
          Can adapt to any level of experience. He is very sociable and we had a
          good time, with the class, outside working hours. I highly recommend,
          the best trainer I have ever seen.

          Antony is a very knowledgeable mentor, especially in regards to React
          and it’s ecosystem showing great capacity of clearly presenting
          important technical aspects while also making then easy to understand.
          He managed to keep the course interesting even for people who already
          had experience in the area. I would recommend him without hesitation.

          I had Antony as a teacher in a course on React JS and Redux and I have
          to say that he proved to be a very prepared, available, and precise
          teacher. His skill was not only to introduce me easily to the topics
          of the course, but above all to explain and illustrate the best
          practices and the correct mental approaches to address the issue in
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excellent professional and above all, a wonderful person. I would love
          to work with him in the future.

          Antony was my teacher in a course related to React and its ecosystem.
          Right from the start you can see the level of preparation and the
          passion he puts into what it does. But even more important is his
          ability to explain in a simple and straightforward way also concepts,
          methodologies, and best practices that are all but simple and
          straightforward. Always friendly and helpful, he also makes sure that
          each of his students understands and can therefore put into practice
          what has been explained. I can only wish to &ldquo;work&rdquo; with
          him again.

          I followed a programming course with web frameworks held by Anthony.
          The energy and passion he transmits are incredible! The thing that
          amazed me the most is his fantastic ability to solve problems: when
          there was something wrong, and you asked for his help, in a blink of
          an eye you knew what error you had done and above all why. If you have
          the opportunity to go and follow his course, you will not regret it!

          Antony&apos;s teaching methods are so well done, so fast paced, so
          rich of details! Having him as my teacher was an honor. He
          doesn&apos;t let anyone stay behind. He explains certain concepts so
          well that you cannot help not seeing them everywhere on well made Web
          Applications. He&apos;s highly energic, he has a rich package of
          knowledge about a lot of frameworks and technologies for web
          development. He knows a lot about mostly everything web related :
          frameworks, Design Patterns, MVC, unit testing, Integration Testing,
          Test Driven Development.. I was sometimes amazed about how someone can
          know so much. Thanks to Antony and the very well done course of
          Angular, Spring, Hibernate and the rich informations he has given me i
          was able to get a job in the web developing field. Thank you Antony!

          Antony is an energetic, active, highly skilled developer, with a
          desire to teach and learn, search for new technologies and share them.
          These are the qualities that he was trying to &ldquo;grow&rdquo; on us
          during the &ldquo;Programming course with java and javascript
          frameworks for the web&rdquo;. Italian is not my mother tongue, but
          Antony was able to teach so that the language difference was not a
          problem.

          &ldquo;threw&rdquo; at us - it was hard but useful! I wish you only
          interesting projects that bring money and satisfaction :).

          I think that people with so much talent and passion for teaching and
          programming are very rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highly updated on the latest news in software development, he
          transmitted his passion with a very high level of challenge making all
          his lessons extremely interesting from all points of view (and this
          means that his lessons were fun and interesting not only as trivial
          notions just to get hired in a company). He was also always available
          to clarify doubts of any kind, with reviews, clarifications,
          corrections of exercises; but always leaving time for individual
          reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at university I had already created a webapp with MVC pattern, with
          Antony I could do the same thing using AngularJS client-side and
          Spring / Hibernate server-side, so I could appreciate all the
          advantages derived from using advanced Frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Antony did not just present these frameworks superficially. He has
          always focused on the latest and most interesting features offered by
          the various frameworks (eg components and Promises in AngularJS),
          making comparisons with features of other equally known frameworks
          that were not in the course program (example React vs. AngularJS),
          with an always attentive look on the news of the future (ECMAScript
          6).
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously I could not even write half the topics that were treated.
        </p>
        <p>I think that following a course was a rare opportunity.</p>
