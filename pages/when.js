      <p>
        In every phase of your business' lifecycle, Inglorious Coderz is there
        to be your perfect tech ally.
      </p>

      <h3>Startups</h3>

      <p>
        An awesome idea is the starting point for your business, but then you
        have to build the real thing. That's when you realize you're really
        putting your future in someone else's hands. Just make sure the person
        you're relying on is able to develop a robust foundation for your
        product. Inglorious Coderz can help in many ways, from assessing your
        CTO's skills to mentoring your devs, or even taking on the role of your
        first CTO.
      </p>

      <h3>Small businesses</h3>

      <p>
        As a small business you know you need an online presence. Also, do you
        find yourself wasting too much time doing small tasks by hand every day?
        That's a hint that you need some automation in your work life.
        Inglorious Coderz can provide you solutions built from scratch so that
        they are tailored to your needs and yours only. Websites are blazingly
        fast because they do not rely on some Wordpress, and have a unique
        design because they are not built from templates. Management software,
        mobile apps and web applications do exactly what you needed, but better.
      </p>

      <h3>Big companies</h3>

      <p>
        Being in the industry for a while, you already know how IT consulting
        works: you pay for a senior and you get a junior that lied on her/his
        CV. Wouldn't it be better to hire people and keep the know-how in-house?
        Definitely. But then, who is going to train them? Who is going to give
        them best practices and standards to follow? Who is going to address
        those hard problems that they cannot solve? The answer to all three is:
        Inglorious Coderz.
