  description: "<p>The Inglorious Coderz project was born as a group of code enthusiasts which meet every Sunday in the Inglorious HQ to study together new technologies and implement open source projects of all kinds (web applications, drones, video games). IC is also a safety net, in which members are trained and directed to interested companies at no charge. In April 15th 2016 I registered for VAT under the same name, in order to welcome some projects during my free time.</p><p>To date I do highly-skilled software consulting and also training on software engineering (design patterns, TDD, eXtreme Programming) using Java and JavaScript technologies as a base. I'm also collaborating with a governative project aimed at engaging a community of developers for the PA.</p>"

  position: Computing professional
  company: Irion Srl
  city: Torino
  country: Italy
  description: "<p>I was hired as the company's 'web expert' to bring my know-how on web applications and the JavaScript language and to apply this knowledge to the reporting section of IrionDQ - their flagship product - always keeping up with the latest trends in terms of architectures and front end technologies. IDQ is a desktop EDM application in WinForm/WPF which enables users to operate on large data sets and to design interactive reports. An OData-powered web API server was recently added to enable some usage from the web.</p><p>After months of R&D I started developing a suite of demos and prototypes that are still showcased to customers today, including: a webapp that explores OData services and allows the user to interact with them, a vertical webapp that simulates financial control activities and price tagging, and an interactive tutorial on how to build client applications that rely on the web API server.</p><p>The know-how acquired during the R&D activity yielded a React/Redux/Redux-Saga architecture that, through the combination of a static JSON layout with dynamic variables, allows the user to design complex and highly interactive reports in the form of grids, charts, and spreadsheets. Because of the huge amount of data to be displayed on the browser I paid much attention to the performance aspect, taking advantage of immutability and memoization as much as possible.</p><p>This architecture is so powerful and performant that lead the company to see it as a successor of IrionDQ. The web-based technology is already a small part of the desktop application and is spreading so to gradually replace the old software with a "universal" version (both online and desktop).</p>"

  city: Turin
  country: Italy
  description: "<p>I started in Rome in a team of eleven people as a simple software developer, but in a few months I was entrusted with various tasks: systems engineer, software architect, tech lead, even presenting our products to customers.</p><p>After a year and a half the company had to close the department but asked me to move to Turin, where in October 2010 I became the company's Mobile Projects tech lead, which meant leading a small team of front end developers, laying down the initial architecture, managing projects that spanned through multiple functional areas, dealing with all the stakeholders including suppliers and sponsors. My team eventually grew up to five members, and together we created and evolved many projects such as a Java back end service for mobile clients and several native apps for Android, Windows Phone, and the web. I created a work environment focused on passion in our work and fun in creating software as a constant challenge towards perfection.</p><p>The PagineGialle and PagineBianche Mobile webapps were subject to compliments from Google for their performances, on which I gave a talk at Codemotion Rome in 2015.</p>"

  description: "<p>My career began as a Java developer for the Public Administration. The team consisted of three people but my autonomy and reliability were appreciated from the beginning, so that eventually I was the only one needed to work on the project and the only interface with the customer.</p><p>The project was a Java desktop application which, combining an XML layout with variables stored on a database, built interactive interfaces with which statisticians could perform analysis on Sector Studies.</p>"
