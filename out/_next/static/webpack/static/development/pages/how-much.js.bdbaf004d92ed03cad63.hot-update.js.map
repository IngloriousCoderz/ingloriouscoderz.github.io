Well, of course our answer will be: it\n          depends. There are lots of factors involved, so we can't just give a\n          mere number.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The price for an Inglorious service ranges from €0 to €1600 a day.\n          Yes, even zero! But unless you can provide some special visibility or\n          you are an endangered species to save, it will be higher than that.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          So how much?
