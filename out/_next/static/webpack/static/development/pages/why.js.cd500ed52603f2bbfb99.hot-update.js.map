They are replacing us in\n            every aspect of life, sometimes performing much better than humans\n            even on tasks that we thought required human interaction.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            No one knows if machines will take us over completely, when will it\n            happen, and what consequences will it have. Maybe we will witness\n            the realization of a utopia in which humans will have nothing to do\n            but enjoy life. Meanwhile, however, people are losing their jobs and\n            starting to feel useless.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            There is only one thing that we humans can still do better than\n            machines: being human. We feel compassion, we care for others, we\n            love what we do. In this industrial, globalized, low-cost society we\n            still appreciate the value of good craftsmanship.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This is Inglorious Coderz: we strongly believe in good software made\n            by good people for good clients.
