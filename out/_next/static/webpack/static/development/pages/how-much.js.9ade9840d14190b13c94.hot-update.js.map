Well, of course our answer will be: it\n          depends. There are lots of factors involved, so we can't just give a\n          mere number.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The price for an Inglorious service ranges from €0 to €1600 a day.\n          Yes, even zero! But unless you can provide something valuable in\n          exchange or you are an endangered species to be saved it will be\n          higher than that.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          So how much? Well, think about the highest fare you are willing to\n          pay. Ok, now add some more. That's the price.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          It's not a joke, and it's actually quite reasonable if you think about\n          it:\n        </p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            As you may have understood already, the Inglorious way is all about\n            crafting beautiful solutions for your problem. The brand itself is a\n            guarantee of this quality. You know how they say: you buy cheap, you\n            buy twice. And we know some many clients that bought cheap before\n            turning to us.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            When you hire an Inglorious Coder, you're actually hiring an entire\n            team of professionals all in one. So instead of hiring an architect\n            for 100 and a developer for 80, you just need to hire an IC for 150\n            and you're good to go.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            A high fare allows us to work less. And when we work less we can\n            spend the rest of our time in improving ourselves, for you. We train\n            to be better teachers, we practice to be better coders, we volunteer\n            to be better humans.\n          </li>\n          <li />\n        </ol>\n      </Trans>\n    </article>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAEA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA/CA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
