Well, of course our answer will be: it\n          depends. There are lots of factors involved, so we can't just give a\n          mere number.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The price for an Inglorious service ranges from €0 to €1600 a day.\n          Yes, even zero! But unless you can provide something valuable in\n          exchange or you are an endangered species to be saved it will be\n          higher than that.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          So how much? Well, think about the highest fare you are willing to\n          pay. Ok, now add some more. That's the price.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          It's not a joke, and it's actually quite reasonable if you think about\n          it:\n        </p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            When you hire one Inglorious Coder, you're actually hiring an entire\n            team of professionals all in one. So instead of hiring a tech lead\n            at 100 and a developer at 80, you hire an IC for 150.\n          </li>\n          <li />\n        </ol>\n      </Trans>\n    </article>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAEA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAjCA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
