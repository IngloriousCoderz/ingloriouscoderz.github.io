Well, of course our answer will be: it\n          depends. There are lots of factors involved, including the client, the\n          project, the working conditions, and many more. We can't just throw a\n          number and that's it.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The price for an Inglorious service ranges from €0 to €2000 a day.\n          Yes, even zero! But unless you can provide something valuable in\n          exchange or you are an endangered species to be saved it will be\n          higher than that.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          So, how much? Well, think about the highest fare you are able to pay.\n          Now think about the highest fare you are <em>willing</em> to pay. Ok,\n          now add some more. That's the price.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          It's not a joke, and it's actually quite reasonable if you think about\n          it:\n        </p>\n      </article>\n\n      <Row>\n        <Column>\n          <Card title=\"Craftsmanship\">\n            <p>\n              As you may have understood already, the Inglorious way is all\n              about crafting beautiful solutions for your problem. If you want a\n              standard solution you can ask a standard consultant. If instead\n              you dream big and want your project to rock, then you found the\n              right guys for the job.\n            </p>\n          </Card>\n        </Column>\n\n        <Column>\n          <Card title=\"One-Man Army\">\n            <p>\n              When you hire an Inglorious Coder, you're actually hiring an\n              entire team of professionals all in one. So instead of hiring an\n              architect for, say, 100 and a developer for 80, you just need to\n              hire an IC for 150 and you're good to go. See how cheap it is?\n            </p>\n          </Card>\n        </Column>\n\n        <Column>\n          <Card title=\"Self-Improvement\">\n            <p>\n              A high fare allows us to work less. And when we work less we can\n              spend the rest of our time in improving ourselves, for you. We\n              train to be better teachers, we practice to be better coders, we\n              volunteer to be better humans. And this will mainly benefit you.\n            </p>\n          </Card>\n        </Column>\n\n        <Column>\n          <Card title=\"Less Is More\">\n            <p>\n              If you think you'll have to pay all that money for six months of\n              work don't be afraid: it won't be six months. Experience taught us\n              that you will need us for much less time, at the end of which you\n              will have a stable, durable and maintainable piece of software.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              On the other hand, you know how they say: you buy cheap, you buy\n              twice. And we know so many clients that bought cheap before\n              turning to us.\n            </p>\n          </Card>\n        </Column>\n\n        <Column>\n          <Card title=\"Because We Can\">\n            <p>\n              We don't do it for the money, we do it for the lulz. That's why\n              the price will never be mandated by the client. It will be agreed\n              upon both parts and it will be the right price &mdash; no more, no\n              less.\n            </p>\n          </Card>\n        </Column>\n\n        <Column>\n          <Card title=\"60% Off\">\n            <p>\n              Since the Italian Revenue Service keeps more than half of our\n              income, and since we will never accept off-books payment, fares\n              must necessarily be kept pretty high.\n            </p>\n          </Card>\n        </Column>\n      </Row>\n    </Trans>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAhGA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
