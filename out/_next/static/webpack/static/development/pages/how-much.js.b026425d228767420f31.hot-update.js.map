Well, of course our answer will be: it\n          depends. There are lots of factors involved, so we can't just give a\n          mere number.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The price for an Inglorious service ranges from €0 to €1600 a day.\n          Yes, even zero! But unless you can provide something valuable in\n          exchange or you are an endangered species to be saved it will be\n          higher than that.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          So how much? Well, think about the highest fare you are willing to\n          pay. Ok, now add some more. That's the price.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          It's not a joke, and it's actually quite reasonable if you think about\n          it:\n        </p>\n      </article>\n\n      <Card>\n        As you may have understood already, the Inglorious way is all about\n        crafting beautiful solutions for your problem. If you want a standard\n        solution you can go to a standard consultant. If instead you dream big\n        and want your project to rock, then you found the right ally.\n      </Card>\n\n      <Card>\n        When you hire an Inglorious Coder, you're actually hiring an entire team\n        of professionals all in one. So instead of hiring an architect for 100\n        and a developer for 80, you just need to hire an IC for 150 and you're\n        good to go.\n      </Card>\n\n      <Card>\n        A high fare allows us to work less. And when we work less we can spend\n        the rest of our time in improving ourselves, for you. We train to be\n        better teachers, we practice to be better coders, we volunteer to be\n        better humans. And this will also benefit to you.\n      </Card>\n\n      <Card>\n        If you think you'll have to pay all that money for six months of work\n        don't be afraid: it won't be six months. Experience taught us that you\n        will need us for much less time, at the end of which you will have a\n        fully working software on the outside, flexible and maintainable on the\n        inside. You will have full control of your creature, and you will be\n        able to go on yourself or hire someone else if you please. On the other\n        hand, you know how they say: you buy cheap, you buy twice. And we know\n        some many clients that bought cheap before turning to us.\n      </Card>\n    </Trans>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAlDA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
